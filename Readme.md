# Exploratory Data Analysis

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is an approach/philosophy for data analysis that employs a variety of techniques (mostly graphical) to:

* maximize insight into a data set;
* uncover underlying structure;
* extract important variables;
* detect outliers and anomalies;
* test underlying assumptions;
* develop parsimonious models; and
* determine optimal factor settings.

*Exploratory Data Analysis* refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.[1](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-8fc1cb20fd15)


The particular graphical techniques employed in EDA are often quite simple, consisting of various techniques of:

* Plotting the raw data (such as data traces, histograms, bihistograms, probability plots, lag plots, block plots, and Youden plots.

* Plotting simple statistics such as mean plots, standard deviation plots, box plots, and main effects plots of the raw data.

* Positioning such plots so as to maximize our natural pattern-recognition abilities, such as using multiple plots per page.[2](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section1/eda11.htm)

This repository has two different EDA:
